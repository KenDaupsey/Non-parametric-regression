# Non-parametric-regression
Exploring non-parametric regression techniques like kernel regression, local polynomial regression, and kernel-based multivariate regression to model complex relationships in data.

Non-parametric Regression
Kernel Method (One Dependent and One Independent Variable)
This repository showcases a Python project on non-parametric regression using the kernel method with one dependent and one independent variable.
Project Overview
The project includes:
Loading the dataset and examining the first 5 rows.
Selecting variables, fitting kernel regression, and plotting the results.
Conducting a permutation test for p-value estimation.
Polynomial Regression
Local Polynomial Regression (LOESS/LOWESS)
Explore local polynomial regression using LOESS/LOWESS for non-parametric regression.
Project Overview
The project involves:
Selecting variables for non-parametric regression.
Fitting a local polynomial regression model and plotting the results.
Performing hypothesis testing to assess the significance of the relationship.
Kernel-Based Multivariate Regression Analysis
One Dependent and Two Independent Variables
Discover kernel-based multivariate regression analysis with one dependent variable ('read') and two independent variables ('write' and 'math').
Project Overview
The project includes:
Selecting variables for non-parametric regression.
Fitting a kernel regression model with two independent variables.
Plotting the original data and regression results in 3D space.
Conducting a permutation test to estimate p-values for hypothesis testing.
